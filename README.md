4. Choose additional deck options.
5. Optionally remove certains cards from the game.
5. Click "Generate" to create a deck of cards that matches your requirements.

## Support This Project

Find this tool useful? Like to see it continually supported?

I am a self-employed software developer who built this in my free time. 
Unfortunately, I can't work on stuff like this all the time as I have to make money to eat and live. 
With your support, I can continue working on this and other great tools for Kerbal Space Program that everyone can benefit from!
